- b0bc847: An agent declares the skills it operates through

  `autoloadSkills` was a reader with nothing to read. OMP honours the field natively for a spawned
  subagent, and the generic `omp-agent` launcher already rendered it as required reading for a main
  session — the consuming half existed on **both** paths. The producing half did not, because the
  corpus had nowhere to declare it. The branch was live code with zero live inputs: every deployed
  definition carried exactly `name` and `description`.

  `Agent.skills` is an optional list of skill NAMES, modelled on the existing optional `preamble`.

  It is deliberately **not a dimension**, for two independent reasons. Structurally, a dimension's
  value is a branded σ\* fragment `agentBody` emits into the Target, while a skill name is an
  address a host resolves — declaring it as a dimension would mint one empty fragment per skill.
  Conceptually, a dimension is a persona trait, and which skills an agent loads is apparatus; the
  catalog would misrepresent it and hand every agent one more required `null` to spell.

  The omp adapter emits it as a third front-matter key, each name through the same `yamlString` the
  description uses. Absent or empty emits nothing, leaving the two-key document unchanged. The
  claude and codex adapters are untouched: neither harness has a field that loads a skill from an
  agent definition, and emitting a key a harness ignores is noise.

  This closes the gap that made every skill binding advisory. A main-session persona now carries
  its required skills in the system prompt on every turn rather than waiting for a description to
  match, and a spawned subagent gets them injected before its first prompt.

### Patch Changes

- e2b2263: A harness-invariant hook asset deploys once, to the vendor-neutral `.agents` root

  The stance rubric is one 27 kB file every projection scores against, byte-for-byte identical
  across claude, codex and omp — and it was being copied into `<harness>/hooks/stance-guardrail/`
  three times. The duplication was the smaller half of the cost. The larger half is that the text
  had **no address any other realization could name**: an advisor roster entry wanting the same
  rubric would have had to `@`-import it out of a sibling harness's tree, which is exactly the
  cross-harness reach `harness-independence` forbids. A shared asset has one address, and the
  neutral root is the one place every harness may read without reaching into another.

  `HookWorker.shared` declares it, `SHARED_STAGE_DIR` stages it, and deploy places it at
  `../.agents/<id>/` — the same relative-escape shape the scoped mechanism modules already use,
  so the manifest keeps it attributable and prune retires it with its hook. The workers resolve
  it by DERIVATION (`.agents` is the sibling of every harness home, three `dirname`s up), never
  by a baked `$HOME`, so a sandboxed `--home` deploy resolves correctly — the same discipline
  that repaired the `$HOME/.claude` leak, applied before it could become one.

  **The criterion is `byte-identical ∧ ¬executable`, and the gate is what corrected it.** The
  first cut said byte-identical alone, and it immediately caught two assets that must NOT move:
  the worker scripts are byte-identical too, and are positionally coupled to the harness in two
  ways their bytes cannot show — each harness's registration addresses its own copy by path, and
  each worker resolves `stance-judge.sh` as a sibling. That judge is genuinely harness-specific
  (it names the harness's own CLI through `{{fact:harness-judge-bin}}`), so a single shared
  worker could not know whose judge to run without the registration passing it in. That trade
  relocates harness-specificity into a shared file's arguments and buys only the deduplication of
  two scripts that belong beside the registration invoking them. An entry point a harness invokes
  is executable; a rubric is not.

  The gate holds both directions and is non-vacuous in both arms: the corpus must contain a shared
  data asset and a harness-specific one, or the rule is green over nothing.

  Verified on a sandboxed two-harness deploy — one rubric on disk, claude and omp both resolving
  `<home>/.agents/stance-guardrail/stance-judge-prompt.md`, including from the pre-guard — and
  live on omp, where the guard blocked twice reading the shared rubric with a tripwire `claude`
  first on `PATH` never invoked.

- 415a112: omp judges in-process; no harness depends on another harness's CLI

  `claude -p` was never an acceptable judge for omp, and it was not acceptable for codex
  either. The backend hardcoded `judge_bin="${STANCE_JUDGE_BIN:-claude}"`, so every harness's
  stance guard required a third vendor's CLI installed, on PATH, and separately
  authenticated. When that OAuth lapsed on the author's host, every verdict on every harness
  failed open in silence — deployed, opted in, correctly scoped, judging nothing.

  **The judge seam is now explicit, and the procedure still has one home.** A host that holds a
  model runs the worker twice around a judgment it makes itself: once with `STANCE_EMIT_PAYLOAD`
  to collect the gated, layer-1-annotated payload and the rubric that scores it, then again with
  `STANCE_VERDICT_FILE` naming its answer. Everything either pass touches before the seam is
  read-only, so the counters, the hash and the verdict log see exactly one pass. The gating,
  extraction, deterministic pre-filter, evidence verification and block accounting stay in the
  worker; only the model call moves.

  **omp's shim takes that seam.** The emitted extension module resolves `modelRoles.advisor`
  (then `smol`, then `tiny`, then the live session model) through `ctx.modelRegistry`, gets auth
  from omp's own registry, and calls `completeSimple` — static-imported from `@oh-my-pi/pi-ai`,
  which omp's loader aliases to its own bundled build. Measured against `omp` v18.1.19: the real
  26.8 kB rubric judged in 1991 ms on a local model, and a live `mav` session blocked, re-opened
  the turn, and settled with a tripwire `claude` first on `PATH` never once invoked.

  The richer `judgment` module (`TextJudge`, `chatTextBackend`, `NoulQuestion`) exists in omp's
  source but is **not** in the bundled compat entrypoint the shipped binary carries; importing it
  silently kills the module load. `completeSimple` is what the binary exposes and what a judge
  needs.

  **The judge binary is now a projection fact, not a literal.** `harness-judge-bin` joins the
  closed `ProjectionFact` set; each adapter answers with its own name — claude `claude`, codex
  `codex`, omp the **empty string**, because it judges in-process and names no subprocess at all.
  An empty value is a real answer and the backend reads it as one, failing open rather than
  falling back to somebody else's CLI.

  **A gate holds the law.** `canon/harness-independence.test.ts` fails if any committed worker
  names another harness's home in executable shell, or if a cell template names a vendor CLI
  where a projection fact belongs. Both legs were convicted before admission: a
  `$HOME/.claude/...` line injected into a committed worker and a `:-claude}` default restored to
  the cell each produced exactly one finding, and removing them returned the gate to green.
  Comments are exempt — a rule that forbids naming `claude` in a sentence would delete the record
  of the repair along with the bug.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 3e9c103: The command ships from one package, and `forge` becomes a library.

  **Breaking, and marked `minor` deliberately.** Pre-1.0, a `minor` bump IS the breaking signal —
  changesets reads `major` on a `0.x` package as a jump to `1.0.0`, which would claim a stability this
  project has not earned while every sibling is still `0.x`.

  **`cratylus` is the package a consumer installs.** It was `@cratylus/invoke`, which
  ARCHITECTURE already described as the composition root; it now carries the build-time entry beside
  the run-time one rather than a third package appearing. **One command.** `cratylus-run` is gone: a second bin existed only because the two surfaces lived
  in two packages and each built its own `cac`. Capability verbs (`cratylus memory encode`) route to
  the runtime, everything else to the projector. The "two DAGs" the split defended are a fact about
  IMPORTS, and imports are what the bundler and the package manager already handle.

  `@cratylus/runtime` renames `runMain` to `runCli` and `RUNTIME_BIN` to `CLI_BIN` — there is one
  command, so the name that said otherwise was a lie. `CLI_BIN` lives in the runtime because it is the
  contract leaf: it depends on nothing, so every package imports the name without inverting an edge.
  The host runtime config follows it to `~/.cratylus.json`.

  It also gains a library face: `import { defineConfig } from 'cratylus'`. A consumer never reaches
  into `@cratylus/forge/config`, so the internal package split stays ours to change.

  **`@cratylus/forge` no longer declares a `bin`** — breaking for anyone invoking it as a program
  rather than importing it. Two manifests declaring one bin name is an install conflict, not a second
  home, so the name has exactly one home and it is the hub's manifest. `CLI_BIN` is handed down by
  whatever mounts the CLI instead of derived from a manifest forge no longer has; that is a parameter,
  not a second spelling. `./cli` is added to the exports map so the hub can mount it.

  **The config file is `cratylus.config.ts`,** and its factory is `defineConfig`. `agents.config.ts`
  named one of four Kinds while governing all four, ignored the near-universal tool-named convention,
  and claimed the most contested filename in the ecosystem. `CONFIG_FILE` now derives from the bin
  name — the config is named after the tool, so it carries the same single-home obligation.

  **`deploy` defaults its render tree** to `.cratylus/<harness>`, what `project` writes. The ordinary
  invocation is `cratylus deploy`; `--agents-dir` / `--skills-dir` / `--hooks-dir` remain as
  overrides, and a missing tree refuses by naming `cratylus project` rather than by demanding a flag.

  **`@cratylus/schema` drops its `@cratylus/runtime` dependency.** It imported nothing from it — the
  edge was repaired in the source on 2026-08-05 and the manifest entry was left behind, so installing
  the shapes package also downloaded the runtime. Schema is the package the whole graph sits on top
  of; its own README already said "this package imports nothing" while its manifest disagreed.

  **`cratylus install` is new** — the zero-config path for an operator with no project. It resolves a
  corpus (the config where one exists, otherwise the corpus the mounting package names), detects the
  harness, renders to a temp tree and places it at user scope. `graphify install [--platform P]` is
  the prior art. Two harnesses on a host refuses and names both rather than choosing one silently.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 6b471c4: Initial public release of Cratylus — the latent-lexicography toolchain.

  `0.1.0` rather than `1.0.0` deliberately: under semver, `0.x` signals a surface that may still break,
  and several concepts are still being cut. The names, however, are settled —
  scope, packages, and both bin names went through the full round-trip (forward argmin, blind reverse
  decode, occupancy check) before this release, because a name is free until first publish and never
  after.

  - `cratylus` — the build-time command: author, resolve, project and deploy a corpus.
  - `cratylus-run` — the run-time command a deployed agent's shims invoke for a capability.
