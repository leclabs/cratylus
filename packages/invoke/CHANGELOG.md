# @cratylus/invoke

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- a019716: Every CLI reports the version its manifest declares.

  `0.1.0` shipped with `cratylus-run --version` and `cratylus --version` answering `0.0.0`: the
  number was a literal in TypeScript, and `changeset version` rewrites manifests rather than
  source, so the two diverged at the first release and would have stayed diverged. Each now
  reads its own manifest by package self-reference, and a gate holds the shape.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 6b471c4: Initial public release of Cratylus — the latent-lexicography toolchain.

  `0.1.0` rather than `1.0.0` deliberately: under semver, `0.x` signals a surface that may still break,
  and several concepts are still being cut. The names, however, are settled —
  scope, packages, and both bin names went through the full round-trip (forward argmin, blind reverse
  decode, occupancy check) before this release, because a name is free until first publish and never
  after.

  - `cratylus` — the build-time command: author, resolve, project and deploy a corpus.
  - `cratylus-run` — the run-time command a deployed agent's shims invoke for a capability.
